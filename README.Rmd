**msafer** is a package that frees users from having to manually find the location of an error when using the function `map()`. When `map()` returns an error, it's unclear where this error occurs. The function `map_safe()` takes in a vector, function and requirements, and spits out `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on whether an error occurs when running the function over the vector. `map_safe()` will return a list of logical returns where it will be easy to identify the place of the error. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of msafer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kpien/msafer")
```
## Example

For demonstration purposes, let's create a sample list of dataframes from the `starwars` and `mtcars` datasets.

```{r}
sample_a <- dplyr::sample_n(dplyr::starwars, 34)
sample_b <- dplyr::sample_n(mtcars, 1:20)
a <- list(dplyr::starwars, sample_a, sample_b)
```

Pass `map_safe_merge()` the same arguments as `map()`. These would be the list of dataframes, the function to map over all the dataframes, and any arguments that the function needs. `map_safe_merge()` will return a tibble with the file numbers and any errors that may have occurred while trying to apply `map()`, grouping repeat errors together.

```{r example}
library(msafer)
map_safe_merge(a, dplyr::select, height)
```
