**msafer** is a package that frees users from having to manually find the location of an error when using the function `map()`. When thereâ€™s something wrong with `map()`, the function only returns the error, but where this error occurs is not provided. The function `map_safe()` takes in a vector, function and requirements, and spits out `TRUE` or `FALSE` based on whether an error occurs when running the function over the vector. `map_safe()` will return a list of logical returns where it will be easy to identify the place of the error. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of msafer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("kpien/msafer")
```
## Example

Pass `map_safe_merge()` the same arguments as `map()`. `map_safe_merge()` will return a tibble with the file numbers and any errors that may have occurred while trying to apply `map()`, grouping repeat errors together.

```{r example}
library(msafer)
map_safe_merge(a, dplyr::select, height)
```
